# dotfiles

A collection of dotfiles used by myself. Mostly for my own reference/use, but handy if anyone else wants to use something I use.

Some of the things in the .bashrc require bash4. If you are running a Mac, you likely have bash3 unless you have installed it from something like homebrew. You can either remove the lines bash complains about, or install bash4.
